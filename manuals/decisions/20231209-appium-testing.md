# Proposed: Appium Testing for Single Device on Windows 11

## Metadata

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Deciders**: V-Sekai
- **Tags**: V-Sekai

## The Backdrop

In the rapidly evolving world of game development, ensuring a seamless user experience across multiple platforms is paramount. This requires rigorous testing methodologies that can effectively simulate real-world scenarios and identify potential issues before they impact the end-user.

## The Challenge

The primary challenge lies in implementing a robust testing framework that can handle cross-platform compatibility, specifically for VR compatible desktop mode on Windows 11.

## The Strategy

Our strategy involves leveraging the capabilities of Appium, a versatile testing framework, for cross-platform testing. However, for this specific test, we will only be focusing on one device type - Windows 11 desktop.

## The Upside

Implementing this strategy will ensure a high-quality gaming experience across various platforms.

## The Downside

The main downside could be the time and resources required to implement and maintain this comprehensive testing strategy. Additionally, there may be unforeseen challenges or limitations associated with the tools and technologies involved.

## The Road Not Taken

Alternative testing frameworks and strategies could have been considered. However, given the specific requirements and constraints of this project, we believe that our proposed strategy offers the best balance of effectiveness and efficiency.

## The Infrequent Use Case

While our strategy covers a wide range of common scenarios in game development, there may be infrequent or edge cases that it does not address. We will need to identify these cases and develop appropriate solutions as needed.

## In Core and Done by Us?

Yes, this strategy is core to our project and will be implemented by our team.
