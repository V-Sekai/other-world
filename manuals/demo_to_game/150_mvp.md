# MVP Proposal

The aim of this project is to create a VR environment using Godot, Elixir, and the JSON-Joy CRDT library. The MVP will focus on developing an interactive virtual space with basic physics, capable of supporting up to 1000 player entities.

## Key Features

1. **VR Prototype**: A simple VR environment with interactive objects and basic physics.
2. **Networking**: Development of a distributed simulation network model using WebRTC for real-time communication between players.
3. **Authority Transfer Mechanism**: A system for transferring control of objects using the JSON-Joy CRDT library to handle synchronization and conflict resolution.
4. **Scalability**: Ensuring the system can support up to 1000 player entities.

## Development Approach

We'll start by creating classes for each type of object (e.g., chair, avatar, ball) that inherit from a base GameObject class. Each class will have properties like name, User_UID, attachments, scale, skeleton, and an array of interactions. We'll implement methods within these classes to allow for manipulation such as dragging and scaling, and also to add or remove interactions based on the object's state.

Our network model will be a distributed simulation model. This model allows all players in the game to interact with the objects and send their states to other players. Although this model is less secure than a client/server model with client-side prediction, it does not require expensive rollback and resimulation.

## Testing and Feedback

We'll define various testing scenarios under different conditions, particularly focusing on concurrent interactions and network latency. We'll also gather data on system performance and user experience, and iteratively refine the system based on feedback.

By applying a smart object interaction model and using a distributed simulation network model, we aim to create a dynamic and interactive environment where players can manipulate objects and share their states with other players. The chair, as a standard test item, will be an excellent starting point for implementing this pattern.
