# MVP Proposal

The objective of this project is to create a VR environment utilizing Godot, Elixir, and the JSON-Joy CRDT library. The MVP will concentrate on developing an interactive virtual space with basic physics that can support up to 1000 player entities.

## Key Features

1. **VR Prototype**: A rudimentary VR environment with interactive objects and fundamental physics.
2. **Networking**: Development of a distributed simulation network model using WebRTC for real-time communication between players.
3. **Authority Transfer Mechanism**: A system for transferring control of objects using the JSON-Joy CRDT library to manage synchronization and conflict resolution.
4. **Scalability**: Ensuring the system can support up to 1000 player entities.

## Not Included in this Phase

While our goal is to create a comprehensive VR experience, certain features will not be included in this initial phase:

- Advanced AI behaviors: While we will provide basic interactions, complex AI-driven behaviors are beyond the scope of this MVP.
- Full physics engine: We will implement basic physics but advanced physics simulations (like fluid dynamics or soft body physics) will not be included.
- Real-world mapping: Incorporating real-world geographic data into the VR environment is not planned for this stage.
- **Backend Services**: Utilization of Elixir for backend tasks like player authentication, state management, and handling WebRTC signaling.
- **Scripting Strategy**: Application of a smart object interaction model in scripting, where objects have potential interactions determined by their state and the attributes of interacting entities.

## Development Approach

We'll begin by creating classes for each type of object (e.g., chair, avatar, ball) that inherit from a base GameObject class. Each class will have properties like name, User_UID, attachments, scale, skeleton, and an array of interactions. We'll implement methods within these classes to allow for manipulation such as dragging and scaling, and also to add or remove interactions based on the object's state.

For features like uploading and constructions, we'll extend the GameObject class to include methods for uploading files and constructing objects. The uploaded files can be stored in the attachments array, and the constructed objects can be added to the interactions array.

Our network model will be a distributed simulation model. This model allows all players in the game to interact with the objects and send their states to other players. Although this model is less secure than a client/server model with client-side prediction, it does not require expensive rollback and resimulation.

## Testing and Feedback

We'll define various testing scenarios under different conditions, particularly focusing on concurrent interactions and network latency. We'll also gather data on system performance and user experience, and iteratively refine the system based on feedback.

By applying a smart object interaction model and using a distributed simulation network model, we aim to create a dynamic and interactive environment where players can manipulate objects and share their states with other players. The chair, as a standard test item, and the ball, as an additional object class, will be excellent starting points for implementing this pattern.
