# Biomimicry Design Process

## Step 1: Define

The first step in the biomimicry design process is to define the problem or opportunity that you want your design to address.

### a. Frame Your Challenge

Give a simple explanation of the impact you want to have. This is not what you want to make, but what you want your design to achieve or do.

### b. Consider Context

Describe some of the contextual factors that are important to the challenge. This could include stakeholders, location conditions, resource availability, etc.

### c. Take a Systems View and Look for Potential Leverage Points

Think about the system surrounding the problem (or opportunity) you are designing for. What interactions and relationships are part of its context? What are the system boundaries and connections to other systems?

### d. Phrase Your Challenge as a Question

Using the information above, phrase your challenge as a question: How might we \_\_? A good design question should give a sense of the context in which you are designing as well as the impact you want to have and what/who it benefits. Your question should be somewhat open-ended to ensure you haven’t jumped to conclusions about what you are designing.

## Step 2: Biologize

Analyze the essential functions and context your design challenge must address. Reframe them in biological terms, so that you can “ask nature” for advice. The goal of this step is to arrive at one or more “How does nature…?” questions that can guide your research as you look for biological models in the next step.

## Step 3: Discover

Look for natural models (organisms and ecosystems) that need to address the same functions and context as your design solution. Identify the strategies used that support their survival and success. This step focuses on research and information gathering.

## Step 4: Abstract

Carefully study the essential features or mechanisms that make the biological strategy successful. Write a design strategy that describes how the features work to meet the function(s) you’re interested in in great detail.

## Step 5: Emulate Nature's Lessons

Once you have found a number of biological strategies and analyzed them for the design strategies you can extract, you are ready to begin the creative part—dreaming up nature-inspired solutions. Here we’ll guide you through the key activities of the Emulate step.

# Note

Please remember that this is a process and it requires your active participation and feedback at every step. Let's start with defining your challenge.
