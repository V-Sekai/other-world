## Prototype 6: Physics

The sixth prototype is dedicated to implementing physics in our virtual world. This will be broken down into two main sections:

### Part 1: Understanding Physics

This section will delve into the basic understanding of physics and how it applies to our virtual world.

### Part 2: Implementation

This part will focus on the actual implementation of physics into our virtual environment. We will discuss the challenges faced and the solutions implemented.
