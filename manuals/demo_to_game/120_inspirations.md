## Inspiration: Desynced: Autonomous Colony Simulator

"Desynced: Autonomous Colony Simulator" is a sci-fi strategy game that stands out due to its focus on fully customizable units and behaviors. Players gather resources, construct buildings, research, and explore unknown territories in the game. The game can be enjoyed solo or with friends, offering a cooperative or individual gameplay experience.

A unique feature of "Desynced" is the enigma surrounding an AI on the verge of self-awareness. Players are tasked with uncovering the hidden truths within this narrative, adding an element of intrigue to the game.

The game combines strategy, automation, and exploration, providing players a dynamic and engaging experience. It emphasizes survival in a sci-fi setting, where players must gather, build, and fight to sustain their colony.

Automating processes and managing a colony against an unfolding story about a self-aware AI adds depth to the gameplay.

# Inspiration: Oxeye Games' demake of Homeworld

There is interest in adapting Oxeye Games' demake of Homeworld for a game jam. This adaptation would bring the iconic space strategy game into the exciting realm of virtual reality.

The game's objective remains unchanged: players must navigate through space searching for their ancestral planet while defending against malevolent extraterrestrials intent on their destruction. The Command Vessel serves as the heart of the player's fleet, acting as both the resource collection point and the hub for unit construction.

The design goals present an exciting challenge. They involve converting the simplified 2D version into a 3D perspective, but this time within an immersive VR environment. The aim is to maintain the essential elements that define the game, including the strategic/tactical switch, while enhancing the player's sense of presence and immersion.

Beyond these foundational ideas, there will be significant creative freedom to craft a unique VR experience. The focus could be on enhancing the "micro" aspect, which ensures smooth control and response during unit movement, and creating a balanced tech tree, all within the confines of a VR interface.
