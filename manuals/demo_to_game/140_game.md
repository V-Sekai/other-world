## Gadget Mechanics

Gadgets play a crucial role in enhancing the gameplay mechanics. Each gadget provides unique abilities that can be utilized strategically within the team-based system:

- **Object Manipulation**: Can create barriers or clear paths, aiding in strategic planning and resource management.
- **Long-Range Targeting**: Useful for snipers or scouts in the team, allowing them to take down targets from a distance. This is not limited to guns but includes any form of ranged gadget.
- **Spell Casting**: Adds complexity to combat situations. Spells can heal teammates, enhance their abilities, or damage enemies.
- **Tactical Overlay**: Provides real-time data about the battlefield, including enemy positions, terrain features, and resource locations.

## Contextual Factors and Gameplay Mechanics

The game we're discussing is set in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has colonized the solar system. It's an open-world game with classless character progression. The gameplay involves player versus player (PvP) and player versus environment (PvE) scenarios, with players forming alliances and strategizing to protect humanity from existential threats. Decisions made in the game can shape the future of the virtual universe.

The gameplay mechanics are designed around a team-based system, encouraging players to form teams and develop strategies under the leadership of a lead. This design promotes strategic planning and effective resource management among players.

## Player Experience

The essence of this game lies in its cooperative environment that rewards teamwork. Challenges and obstacles require a collective effort and strategy. Victory over obstacles is a shared experience, creating a sense of camaraderie among players.

"Skill gates" are a unique feature in the game that serve as checkpoints. These gates require players to demonstrate a specific skill they've learned to progress.

The level design plays a crucial role in ensuring that players acquire the necessary skills and abilities before encountering significant challenges. This is achieved through various means:

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Early levels are relatively straightforward, allowing players to learn the basic mechanics and controls of the game.
- **Skill-Based Challenges**: Obstacles that require certain skills to overcome.
- **Rewarding Exploration**: Hidden areas or secret paths might contain power-ups or abilities to help players in future challenges.
- **Boss Battles**: Placed at the end of levels or sections, these act as tests of the skills and abilities players have gained throughout the level.

## Teamwork Over Solo Play

In this game, teamwork is given more importance than solo play. This design choice reflects the game's cooperative nature, where players are encouraged to form parties or teams and face challenges together.

The game's cooperative gameplay design ensures that many of its missions and challenges are best tackled as a team. The game allows players to form parties or teams to support this cooperative gameplay.

## Custom Avatars and Voice Chat

The game offers two key features that significantly enhance the player experience: custom avatars and voice chat.

- **Custom Avatars**: Empowers players to craft unique, personalized characters or avatars, using VRM or custom Godot scenes to represent themselves within the game world.
- **Voice Chat**: Provides a platform for real-time communication between players. It's a vital tool for strategic planning and coordination among team members.
