## Prototype 7: Server Capacity and Bandwidth Limit

The seventh and final prototype is focused on server capacity and bandwidth limit and is divided into two main sections:

### Part 1: Server Capacity

In this section, we will work towards ensuring that the server can handle up to 100 people per instance.

### Part 2: Bandwidth and Object/Mesh Complexity Limit

Game optimization will involve calculating the bandwidth and determining the object/mesh complexity limit.
