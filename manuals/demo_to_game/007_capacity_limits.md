## Prototype 7: Server Capacity and Bandwidth Limit

The seventh and final prototype is focused on server capacity and bandwidth limit. This will be divided into three main sections:

### Part 1: Server Capacity

In this section, we will work towards ensuring that the server can handle up to 100 people per instance.

### Part 2: Bandwidth and Object/Mesh Complexity Limit

This part will involve calculating the bandwidth and determining the object/mesh complexity limit.

### Part 3: Project Timeline

The estimated timeline for this project is between 2 to 4 weeks. We will discuss the schedule in detail, including milestones and potential challenges.
