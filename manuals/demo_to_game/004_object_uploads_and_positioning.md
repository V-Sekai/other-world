## Prototype 4: Object Uploads and Positioning

This prototype is divided into two main sections:

### Part 1: Object Uploads

In this part, we will develop the capability to upload various objects. These include:

- A teacup (which could possibly be a collider)
- An avatar

### Part 2: Object Positioning

Once the objects have been uploaded, users will have the ability to manipulate these objects in the following ways:

- Dragging
- Scaling

The objects will have the following properties:

- **Name**: The name of the object.
- **User_UID**: The unique identifier for the user.
- **Attachments**: This includes:
  - Avatar (which consists of materials, meshes, animations)
  - Colliders
- **Scale**: The scale of the object.
- **Skeleton**: The skeleton structure of the object.
