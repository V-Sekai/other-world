# Prototype 2: Packaging, Marker3D, and Quad Plane

This prototype involves several key components:

## Packaging Colliders and Per Bone Capsules

The first part of this prototype is focused on packaging colliders and per bone capsules. These elements will be prepared for upload/download processes.

## Introduction of Marker3D

We will introduce a `Marker3D` at coordinates `(0, 0, 1)`. This will serve as a reference point in the 3D space.

## Addition of Quad Plane

Lastly, we will add a quad plane to our virtual world. This will serve as a basic surface or platform within the environment.
