# V-Sekai Other World Architecture: Overview

The V-Sekai Other World Architecture project aims to create a virtual world using the binary Godot Engine client and server. The development process is divided into several prototypes, each with its own specific goals and objectives.

> **Note:** Instead of working on a car engine, work on the body. Instead of a bicycle wheel, work on the frame.

> **Vision:** Our V-Sekai Other World Architecture project aims to infuse shared creativity into virtual spaces. We're building a platform for users to create and interact together, fostering community. Imagine a user crafting a heart-shaped gift for his future wife in this shared realm.
