# Proposed: Triangle to Quad Mesh Dataset Creation

## Context

Mesh Transformers, which consist of a construction worker (auto encoder) and an architect (transformer), aim to simplify the process of generating 3D models. Users can generate a 3D model using a prompt, eliminating the need to search through numerous 3D libraries.

## Problem Statement

The task at hand is to create a triangle mesh to quad mesh dataset that's suitable for machine learning training. The meshes should be converted from triangles to quads, have captions, contain a maximum of 1k quads, and include at least 100 objects.

Note that quad mesh to triangle mesh is not the same task.

## Proposal

We propose using remeshing tools convert triangle meshes to quad meshes.

- caption
- type annotation
- material annotation

## Benefits

This proposal simplifies the process of creating 3D models. It allows users to quickly receive a 3D model that fits their needs.

## Downsides

The proposal may require significant computational resources. Additionally, there may be some loss of detail during the conversion process.

## Road Not Taken

An alternative approach would involve manually converting each quad mesh to a triangle mesh and adding captions. However, this method would be time-consuming and not feasible for large datasets.

## Infrequent Use Case

The proposal may not benefit users who only need a small number of 3D models or those with very specific requirements.

## In Core and Done by Us

The V-Sekai development team will be responsible for creating and converting the meshes.
