TODO OPT:
- Lazy node calling (can be useful to prevent missing error)

BUGS:
- Fine bump still produces wrong result when using non UV texture mapping (V)
- Sharp bump can cause bleed on color channel (V)
- Value channel should output only grayscale (V)
- Wrong result after adding layer modifier (V, need more testing)
- Transition AO at flip produce wrong result (V)
- Bring back modifier on normal channel at Color layer (V)
- Childen layers produce wrong result after delete parent only (V)
- Float image still lose precision after packed (its very apparent on bump effect) (V, not a problem on Blender 2.8)
- Musgrave fine bump cannot read below 0.0 (??)
- Bake result is slightly darker when using emission shader (or any shader?? not thoroughly tested yet)
- UV overlay on image editor is not transformed if uv is transformed (V)
- Standard image layer fails to use image atlas (V)
- Layer preview mode does not change to missing color when enabling/disabling layer (V)
- Bake crashes on Blender 2.90.1 (V, Blender 2.91 fixes it)
- Wrong temp UV if layer selected again (V, maybe)
- Alpha fails to connect to original target socket when toggling channel use alpha
- No number suffix when creating new image mask
- No number suffix when duplicate layers
- Rename vcol that used in other layer caused missing data
- Refresh Neighbor UV sometimes appear on layer Normal channel that uses second UV
- Transfer UV does not work
- Bake will throw error if there's no unwrapped object using same material (V)
- Bake will throw error if there's object using same material with render/view turned off (V)
- Changed color after unpack image (V)
- Invert image can cause crash (~, Cannot fix, actual blender bug)
- Image atlas should not be unpacked (~)
- Bake multires without multires or with disabled multires will cause error (V)
- Bake to layer overwrite always on despite already turning it off (V)
- Overwrite option always showed up when baking other object (~, probably already fixed, cannot reproduce again)
- Normal override channel possibly have issue with different uv than main uv (V)
- Move channel modifier will cause error (V)
- Blender 2.80 until 2.91 cannot use vertex color alpha (V)
- Duplicate solid color with mask can cause error (V)
- Using yp on non-mesh object can cause error (V)
- Resize image with image atlas does not work (V)
- Baking object with no vertex will cause error (V)
- Baked channel images sometimes dissapeared after save all
- Rezise image atlas to maximum size (4k at default) can erase other image atlas user (V)

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Cycles has limit of 32 images per material, NOT per node_tree (V) Can be get around by using image atlas
- Limit decrease to 20 images if alpha is used (V) Can be get around by using image atlas
- Use of cineon images will cause crash (??)
- Hemi/fake lighting layer doesn't work with bump/normal on cycles, no known workaround found (~V, hemi temp bake is already implemeted)
- Baking object with multi materials need temporary uv manipulation, without that all uv will be baked, which is not ideals (V)
