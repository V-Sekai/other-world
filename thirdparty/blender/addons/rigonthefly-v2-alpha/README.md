# RigOnTheFly
Version : 2.0.0-alpha

Rig on the Fly is a Blender 3.0 dynamic rigging tool used to simplify and speed up animation workflow.  
Inspired by Richard Lico's GDC 2018 talk: [Animating Quill: Creating an Emotional Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3CzLVpuE4k&t=2011s) and his Animation Sherpa Space Switching course.  
  
The main goal of Rig on the Fly is to facilitates animators job by automating repetitive tasks such as rigging. It does so by modularizing the rig allowing changes to how it functions on the fly without losing motion. Letting animators focus on performance rather than find ways to circumvent rig limitations.

Rig on the Fly is the result of my brother's and my free time, used to improve my personal animation workflow. We are sharing this tool in case it helps others animate in Blender 3D.
