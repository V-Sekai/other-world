# V-Sekai's VR Stellar Odyssey

V-Sekai, an open-source group known for their innovative "other-world" projects, has expressed interest in adapting Oxeye Games' demake of Homeworld for a game jam. This adaptation would bring the iconic space strategy game into the exciting realm of virtual reality.

The objective of the game remains unchanged: players must navigate through space in search of their ancestral planet while defending against malevolent extraterrestrials intent on their destruction. The Command Vessel continues to serve as the heart of the player's fleet, acting as both the resource collection point and the hub for unit construction.

The design goals present an interesting challenge. They involve converting the simplified 2D version back into a 3D perspective, but this time within an immersive VR environment. The aim is to maintain the essential elements that define the game, including the strategic/tactical switch, while also enhancing the player's sense of presence and immersion.

Beyond these foundational ideas, V-Sekai will have a significant amount of creative freedom to craft their own VR experience. They could choose to focus on enhancing the "micro" aspect, which ensures smooth control and response during unit movement, and creating a balanced tech tree, all within the confines of a VR interface.
