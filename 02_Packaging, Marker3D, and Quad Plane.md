## Prototype 2: Packaging, Marker3D, and Quad Plane

This prototype involves packaging colliders and per bone capsules for upload/download. We will introduce a Marker3D at coordinates (0, 0, 1) as a reference point in the 3D space. Additionally, we will add a quad plane to our virtual world, which will serve as a basic surface or platform within the environment.
