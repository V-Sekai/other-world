## Prototype 5: Server Management and Scripting

This prototype is divided into two main sections:

### Part 1: Server Management

In this part, we will focus on various server management considerations. These include:

- Handling server downtime
- Managing user logouts/logins

### Part 2: Scripting

In the second part of this prototype, we will incorporate scripting into the system. This will allow for more dynamic and interactive functionalities.
