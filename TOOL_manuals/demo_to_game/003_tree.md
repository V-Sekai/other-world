## Prototype 3: Tree Concept Decision and Texture Packaging

This prototype is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Tree Concept Decision

In this part, we will make a decision between the following concepts:

- **GLTF2 Concept of a Unified Node Tree**: This is one of the options we are considering.

- **Godot Engine / Blender Concept of Armatures**: This is the alternative option under consideration.

### Part 2: Texture Packaging

Once the tree concept decision has been made, we will move on to the packaging of various elements at the marker. These include:

- Textures
- Materials
- Meshes
- IDs
