# Proposed: VR Game with 960 Players

## The Context

We aim to create a virtual reality (VR) game that can support one thousand players simultaneously.

## The Problem Statement

The challenge lies in managing the load of player simulations, world servers, and game state delivery.

### Player Simulation Results

```gdscript
# Create 80 player nodes, each on a separate SQLite database on a TBD CPU bare metal machine
# Requires 12 player servers for 960 players
extends Node

class_name Player
var id : String
var state : PackedByteArray

var db := MVSQLite.new()
var http_request = HTTPRequest.new()

# Declare the query as an instance variable
var insert_query

func _ready():
    self.add_child(http_request)
    http_request.connect("request_completed", self, "_on_request_completed")

    var player := Player.new()
    player.id = generate_uuid()
    player.state = PackedByteArray()

    var err = http_request.request("http://localhost:7001/api/create_namespace",
                                   ["Content-Type: application/json"],
                                   true,
                                   HTTPClient.METHOD_POST,
                                   '{"key":"' + player.id + '"}')
    if err == OK:
        print("Request sent")
    else:
        print("Error sending request")

    if db.open(player.id):
        var sql := "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS players (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, state BLOB)"
        var query = db.create_query(sql)
        query.execute()

        sql = "INSERT INTO players (id, state) VALUES (?, ?)"
        insert_query = db.create_query(sql)

    else:
        print("Error: ", db.get_last_error_message())

func update_player_states(players):
    for player in players:
        # TODO: open player databases
        var db = dbs[player.id % 100]
        var sql := "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO players (id, state) VALUES (?, ?)"
        var query = db.create_query(sql)
        query.execute([player.id, player.state])

func _process(_delta):
    var player_state := PackedByteArray()
    for j in range(10):
        player_state.append(randi() % 256)

    var player := Player.new()
    player.id = generate_uuid()
    player.state = player_state

    insert_query.execute([player.id, player.state])

    if insert_query.get_last_error_message() != "":
        print("Error: ", insert_query.get_last_error_message())

func _on_request_completed(result, response_code, headers, body):
    var str = body.get_string_from_utf8()
    if response_code == 200:
        print("Request completed successfully")
    else:
        print("Request failed with response code: ", response_code)
        print("Response body: ", str)

func generate_uuid() -> String:
    var uuid := PackedByteArray.generate_random_bytes(16)
    return "%02x%02x%02x%02x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x" % [
        uuid[0], uuid[1], uuid[2], uuid[3], uuid[4], uuid[5], uuid[6], uuid[7],
        uuid[8], uuid[9], uuid[10], uuid[11], uuid[12], uuid[13], uuid[14], uuid[15]
    ]
```

### World Servers

We are going with the grid approach. Our world is a 1km by 1km area and each grid cell is 100m squared.

Player servers need to regularly update the world server with the state of each player.

After the player simulation completes, the player server forwards the shallow player state to the world server 100 times per second.

A 1x1 grid of 100m squared requires 1 world server.

The World Server goes to the player databases and selects, modifies, and inserts.

```gdscript
var id : int
var dbs = []

func _init():
    for i in range(80):
        var db := MVSQLite.new()
        if !db.open("world_server_" + str(i) + ".db"):
            print("Error: ", db.get_last_error_message())
        else:
            dbs.append(db)

func update_player_states(players):
    for player in players:
        var db = dbs[player.id % 80]
        var sql := "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO players (id, state) VALUES (?, ?)"
        var query = db.create_query(sql)
        query.execute([player.id, player.state])

        if query.get_last_error_message() != "":
            print("Error: ", query.get_last_error_message())

func get_player_states():
    var player_states = []
    for db in dbs:
        var sql := "SELECT id, state FROM players"
        var query = db.create_query(sql)
        query.execute([])

        while query.step() == SQLiteQuery.BUSY:
            var player_state = {}
            player_state["id"] = query.get_column_text(0)
            player_state["state"] = query.get_column_blob(1)
            player_states.append(player_state)

    return player_states
```

### World Database

Our player server is designed to accommodate up to 80 game players. These players are distributed across TBD CPUs. Each CPU is tasked with managing a total of TBD players.

To handle such a load, we run TBD processes per CPU. These processes block on some asynchronous calls out to world servers.

Our choice of database for this world is SQLite FoundationDB.

### Game State Delivery

The game state delivery process involves each world server generating a stream of data containing the states of all players. This data is then sent to the client-side for rendering and interaction.

```gdscript
var db := MVSQLite.new()
var query = null

func _init():
    if !db.open("world_server_01"):
        print("Error: ", db.get_last_error_message())
    else:
        prepare_query()

func prepare_query():
    var sql := "SELECT id, state FROM players"
    query = db.create_query(sql)

func get_player_states():
    if query == null:
        print("Error: Query not prepared")
        return []

    var results = query.execute([])

    var player_states = []
    for row in results:
        var player_state = {}
        player_state["id"] = row[0]
        player_state["state"] = row[1]
        player_states.append(player_state)

    return player_states
```

This list can then be used to generate the TBD mbit/sec stream of packets that is sent from each world server. The total of TBD mbit generated per second is achieved by running this process across all 12 world servers.

Please note that the limiting factor here is due to the lack of multicast support over the internet.

### State updates per second

| Server Type         | Operation | Frequency | Transactions per Second | Server Inputs  | Server Outputs |
| ------------------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | - |
| Player              | Write     | 100 FPS   | 100 * ( 12 + 80 ) writes/sec          | 80 (from player)                     | 12 (to worlds) + 80 (to database) |
| World               | Write     | 100 FPS   | 100 * ( 12 ) writes/sec + 100 * 100 * (12 ) reads          | 80 (from database)                     |  12 (to player servers) |

## The Benefits

- Supports a large number of players simultaneously
- Provides a rich, immersive gaming experience

## The Downsides

- Requires significant resources and infrastructure
- Bandwidth requirements may be high for some players
- Lack of multicast support over the internet could limit game state delivery

## The Road Not Taken

An alternative would be to limit the number of players, but this would compromise the scale and immersion of the game.

## The Infrequent Use Case

In cases where player traffic is consistently low, the infrastructure may be underutilized.

## In Core and Done by Us

The proposed stress testing will be conducted by the V-Sekai development team.
