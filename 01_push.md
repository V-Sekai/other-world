# Prototype 1: Element Instantiation and Uploading

In this prototype, we will instantiate elements into our virtual world and pull them for user interaction. These elements include:

1. **Colliders**: Invisible objects that simulate solid matter.
2. **Per Bone Capsules**: Simplified user avatars used for collision detection.
