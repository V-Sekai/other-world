# Prototype 1: Element Instantiation and Uploading

This prototype involves two main steps:

## Instantiating Elements into the Virtual World

The first part of this prototype is focused on instantiating elements into our virtual world. These elements will be available for user interaction.

### Elements include:

1. **Colliders**: These are invisible objects that simulate solid matter.
2. **Per Bone Capsules**: These are simplified user avatars used for collision detection.

## Pulling Elements for User Interaction

After instantiation, these elements will be pulled for user interaction. This allows users to interact with the colliders and per bone capsules within the virtual environment.
