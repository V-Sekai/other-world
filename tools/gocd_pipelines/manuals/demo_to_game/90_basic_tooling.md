# Basic Tooling: Bill of Materials

This section outlines the essential tools we use in our VR world architecture.

## VR Software

We utilize:

1. **Godot Engine**: An open-source game engine supporting both 2D and 3D games as well as interactive experiences.
2. **Blender**: A comprehensive, free, and open-source 3D creation suite.

## File Formats

We adhere to the following standards for 3D models:

- **glTF (GL Transmission Format)**: A standard file format for three-dimensional scenes and models.
- **VRM**: A 3D avatar file format for VR applications based on glTF 2.0.
- **Godot Scene (.tscn)**: Godot's native scene format.

## Software Languages

Software languages are indispensable for infusing interactivity into our VR worlds:

- **C++**
- **GDScript**: The native scripting language for Godot Engine.
- **Elixir**

## Infrastructure Automation Tools

To manage and automate our infrastructure, we use:

- **OpenTofu**: An open-source infrastructure as code software tool.
- **VictoriaMetrics** A fast, cost-effective and scalable time series database.

## Local and Cloud Storage

For local storage, we use:

- **SeaweedFS**: A simple and highly scalable distributed file system.

For cloud storage, we use:

- **Cloud's S3 Compatible Storage**: Many cloud service providers offer storage solutions that are compatible with the S3 API.

## Database

Our choice for database management is **CockroachDB**, an open-source, distributed SQL database.

## Hardware

To test and experience our virtual worlds, VR hardware is essential:

- **VR Headsets**: Devices such as the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, Beyond HMD, or Valve Index.
- **Controllers**: These devices facilitate user interaction with the virtual environment.
- **VR GPUs**: Graphics processing units for rendering VR content.

## Performance Testing

Load test our VR world architecture. It simulates a user-defined number of users to stress test a URL.
