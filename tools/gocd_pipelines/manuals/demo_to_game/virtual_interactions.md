# Emulate Nature's Lessons

Emulating nature's lessons involves taking the abstracted design strategy and applying it to our specific problem. In this case, we're designing a VR interface that allows users to interact with virtual objects in a natural and intuitive way.

Here's how we can emulate nature's lessons:

1. **Direct Manipulation**: We'll allow users to interact directly with virtual objects using their hands or controllers. This will involve tracking the user's hand movements and translating them into actions within the VR environment.

2. **Multi-Sensory Feedback**: We'll provide feedback through multiple senses to help users understand the results of their actions. This could involve visual changes in the VR environment, sounds, and haptic feedback through the controllers.

3. **Contextual Information**: We'll use visual and auditory cues to provide contextual information. For example, objects might get larger as they get closer, or make different sounds depending on their material.

By emulating these features of human interaction with physical objects, we can create a VR interface that feels natural and intuitive to use.
