# V-Sekai: Focusing on PCVR vs Android Build

## Context

V-Sekai is a project that aims to bring social VR functionality to the Godot Engine. The current dilemma is whether to focus on an Android build, ditch PCVR as the primary platform or continue focusing on PCVR.

## Problem Statement

The team lacks a high-powered enterprise sales team for enterprise PCVR. The mobile Vulkan is considered because it can use compute shaders to skeleton skin meshes for large avatar counts. However, Meta dominates the market for standalone VR headsets, and competing with them requires a superior product.

## Proposal

Given the current market situation and V-Sekai's capabilities, we should focus on PCVR. This platform can offer high-quality AAA games with lots of content, which standalone games cannot currently provide.

## Benefits

- High-quality AAA games with lots of content.
- Less competition compared to the standalone VR market.
- Potential to corner the gaming market if competitors are distracted.

## Downsides

- A significant investment in PCVR development is required.
- The market for PCVR is growing but lacks a spotlight.

## The Road Not Taken

Focusing on an Android build would mean entering a highly competitive market dominated by established players like Meta. It would also require selling consoles at a loss and aggressively pursuing game developers for exclusive content, which is a losing strategy.

## Infrequent Use Case

If Meta decides to chase Apple into the consumer AR market, leaving the gaming market, there could be an opportunity for V-Sekai to fill the gap.

## In Core and Done by Us

The decision to focus on PCVR will be a core strategy for V-Sekai, which the development team will implement.
