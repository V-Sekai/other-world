# Proposal: Stress Testing Godot Engine's Networking System

## Objective

The objective of this proposal is to ensure that the networking system of the Godot engine can handle a high load and perform optimally under stress. This is crucial for our project which involves avatar, world, and prop collaboration workflow in the Godot engine.

## Proposed Solution

We propose to conduct stress testing on the Godot engine's networking system. This will involve creating multiple virtual users and simulating high traffic scenarios to evaluate how the system performs under heavy load.

Here's an example of how you might do this:

```gdscript
# Assuming we have a list of props and a World instance
var props = [prop1, prop2, prop3]
var world = World.new()

for i in range(1000): # Simulate 1000 users
    var user = User.new() # Create a new user
    var selected_props = [] # List to store selected props

    for _ in range(randi()%props.size()+1): # Randomly select props
        var prop = props[randi()%props.size()]
        selected_props.append(prop)

    user.glue_props(selected_props) # Glue selected props together
    world.merge(user.get_changed_world()) # Merge the changed world into the main world

# Now, let's read back the changed world
print(world.get_state())
```

## Expected Benefits

- Identify potential bottlenecks in the system.
- Ensure the system can handle high traffic without compromising performance.
- Improve overall system reliability and user experience.

## Potential Downsides

- Requires time and resources to set up and conduct the tests.
- Potential for false positives or negatives due to the simulated nature of the test.

## Alternatives

An alternative would be to skip stress testing and directly implement the system. However, this could lead to unforeseen issues in a live environment, potentially affecting user experience.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, stress testing is a crucial step in ensuring the robustness and reliability of our Godot engine's networking system. It will help us identify potential issues early on and ensure a smooth user experience.
