		Class for importing and exporting glTF files in and out of Godot.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		GLTFDocument supports reading data from a glTF file, buffer, or Godot scene. This data can then be written to the filesystem, buffer, or used to create a Godot scene.
		All of the data in a GLTF scene is stored in the [GLTFState] class. GLTFDocument processes state objects, but does not contain any scene data itself. GLTFDocument has member variables to store export configuration settings such as the image format, but is otherwise stateless. Multiple scenes can be processed with the same settings using the same GLTFDocument object and different [GLTFState] objects.
		GLTFDocument can be extended with arbitrary functionality by extending the [GLTFDocumentExtension] class and registering it with GLTFDocument via [method AssetDocument3D.register_gltf_document_extension]. This allows for custom data to be imported and exported.
