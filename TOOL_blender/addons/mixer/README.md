# Mixer

Mixer is a Blender addon for real-time collaboration in Blender. It allows multiple Blender users to work on the same scene simultaneously and is developed by the R&D department of Ubisoft Animation Studio.

**Please note that Ubisoft is no longer maintaining this project. The V-Sekai team is now maintaining Mixer.**

**Disclaimer**: Although designed to be used in a production context, it is still an experimental tool. Despite our best efforts to make it reliable, it may, under certain circumstances, corrupt your Blender scenes data. Please note that neither Ubisoft nor Ubisoft employees can be held responsible in such cases. Use it at your own risk.

**However, we will do our best to improve Mixer based on your feedback to provide a memorable creative collaborative experience. Have fun!**
