# Basic Tooling: Bill of Materials

This section outlines the essential tools we use in our VR world architecture.

## VR Software

The creation of virtual worlds necessitates specific software. We utilize:

1. **Godot Engine 4.2**: An open-source game engine renowned for its power and versatility, supporting both 2D and 3D games as well as interactive experiences.
2. **Blender**: A comprehensive, free, and open-source 3D creation suite that caters to all aspects of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, and motion tracking.

## File Formats

We adhere to the following standards for 3D models:

- **glTF (GL Transmission Format)**: This is a standard file format for three-dimensional scenes and models. It's designed for efficient transmission and loading of 3D content.
- **VRM**: This is a 3D avatar file format for VR applications. It's based on glTF 2.0 and allows for the use of humanoid animations and interactions in VR.
- **Godot Scene (.tscn)**: This is Godot's native scene format. It's text-based, making it friendly for version control systems.

## Software Languages

Software languages are indispensable for infusing interactivity into our VR worlds:

- **C++**: This versatile language empowers developers to script intricate behavior.
- **GDScript**: As the native scripting language for Godot Engine, GDScript is game-specific and boasts a simple syntax akin to Python.
- **Elixir**: A dynamic, functional language engineered for crafting scalable and maintainable applications.

## Infrastructure Automation Tools

To manage and automate our infrastructure, we use:

- **Terraform**: An open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services.
- **Ansible**: An open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code.

## Database

Our choice for database management is **CockroachDB**, an open-source, distributed SQL database designed for building, scaling, and managing modern, data-intensive applications.

## Hardware

To test and experience our virtual worlds, VR hardware is essential:

- **VR Headsets**: Devices such as the Meta Quest 3, Beyond HMD, or Valve Index offer the means to view and interact with our virtual worlds.
- **Controllers**: These devices facilitate user interaction with the virtual environment, providing a more intuitive interface than traditional input devices.
