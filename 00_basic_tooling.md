# Basic Tooling: Bill of Materials

This section will cover the basic tools required in our VR world architecture.

## VR Software

Creating virtual worlds requires specific software. Here are the ones we use:

1. **Godot Engine 4.0**: This is a powerful and open-source game engine that supports both 2D and 3D games and interactive experiences.
2. **Blender**: This is a free and open-source 3D creation suite that supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, and motion tracking.

## Scripting Languages

Scripting languages are essential for adding interactivity to our VR worlds:

- **C++**: A versatile language that allows developers to script complex behavior.
- **GDScript**: The native scripting language for Godot Engine, GDScript is designed specifically for games and offers a simple syntax similar to Python.
- **Elixir**: A dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.

## Database

We use **CockroachDB**, an open-source, distributed SQL database that lets you build, scale, and manage modern, data-intensive applications.

## Hardware

VR hardware is necessary for testing and experiencing our virtual worlds:

- **VR Headsets**: Devices like the Meta Quest 3, Beyond HMD, or Valve Index provide the means to view and interact with our virtual worlds.
- **Controllers**: These devices allow users to interact with the virtual environment in a more intuitive way than traditional input devices.
